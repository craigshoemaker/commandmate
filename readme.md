CommandMate is a utility that makes following along with command-based tutorials a snap. Often online tutorials contain a series of commands what include placeholders for your custom values.

CommandMate automatically identifies placeholders and handles the search and replace. All that is left for you to do is copy each command and execute in your favorite command line shell!

Handy features:

- **Automatic saving:** Values command text and key/value pairs are saved upon each change so you can leave and pick up back where you started.
- **Comments lines:** Lines beginning with `//` are rendered as titles while `//!!` are rendered as warnings.
